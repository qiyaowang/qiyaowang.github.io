Double asterisks (**) or double underscores (__) are treated as bold using the <strong> tag. To create italic or bold text, simply wrap your words in single/double asterisks/underscores. For example, **My double emphasis text** becomes My double emphasis text, and *My single emphasis text* becomes _My single emphasis_ **text**.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use a special Markdown character in your document (such as displaying literal asterisks), you can escape the character with the backslash (\\). Markdown will ignore the character directly after a backslash. \\*","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
